	Cosmos without hatred
	Stars like diamonds in your eyes
	The ground can be space (space, space, space, space)
	With feet marching towards a peaceful sky
	All the Moonmen want things their way
	But we make sure they see the sun
	Goodbye, Moonmen
	We say goodbye, Moonmen
	Goodbye, Moonmen
	Goodbye, Moonmen
	Oh, goodbye
	Cosmos without hatred
	Diamond stars of cosmic light
	Quasars shine through endless nights
	And everything is one in the beauty
	And now we say goodbye, Moonmen
	We say goodbye, Moonmen
	Goodbye, Moonmen
	Goodbye, Moonmen
	Oh, goodbye
	Shut the fuck up about Moonmen!";
